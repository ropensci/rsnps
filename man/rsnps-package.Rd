\title{Get SNP (Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism) Data on the Web}
\description{
This package gives you access to data from OpenSNP (https://opensnp.org)
via their API (https://opensnp.org/faq#api) and NCBI's dbSNP SNP database
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp).
}
\section{NCBI Authentication}{

This applies the function \code{\link[=ncbi_snp_query]{ncbi_snp_query()}}:

You can optionally use an API key, if you do it will
allow higher rate limits (more requests per time period)

To get an API key from NCBI you can login to create a key via your account settings at
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/settings/

#' Note: NCBI login is via with a 3rd party account (e.g. Google, orcid, etc.).
If you had an already existing NCBI account you can link it with a 3rd party
login and then you can retire your old NCBI login if you haven't already),
otherwise just #' create a new account.

Once you are logged on to your NCBI account settings (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/account/settings/)
you can go to the section "API Key Management"

Here you can select "Create an API Key" (which will give you up to 10 requests
per second, instead of the 3 per second without the API key.).

After generating your key,  set an environment variable as \code{ENTREZ_KEY} in
.Renviron. This .Renviron file can be edited using \code{usethis::edit_r_environ()}
or by locating and creating/editing this file yourself.

\code{ENTREZ_KEY='youractualkeynotthisstring'}

Once the API is added to your .Renviron file you can then restart R for
this to take effect.

You can optionally pass in your API key to the key parameter in NCBI
functions in this package. However, it's much better from a security
perspective to set an environment variable.
