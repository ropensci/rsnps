Title: Get 'SNP' ('Single-Nucleotide' 'Polymorphism') Data on the Web
Description: A programmatic interface to various 'SNP' 'datasets'
    on the web: 'OpenSNP' (<https://opensnp.org>), 'NBCIs' 'dbSNP' database
    (<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP>), and Broad Institute 'SNP'
    Annotation and Proxy Search
    (<http://archive.broadinstitute.org/mpg/snap/ldsearch.php>). Functions
    are included for searching for 'SNPs' for the Broad Institute and 'NCBI'.
    For 'OpenSNP', functions are included for getting 'SNPs', and data for
    'genotypes', 'phenotypes', annotations, and bulk downloads of data by user.
